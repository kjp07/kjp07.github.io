      <h2>Chapter 1: First Encounter</h2>
      <p>I came across Dinky Dino at the bus stop. I had several thoughts when I did.</p> 
      <a title="Click me!" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank"><img src="Chrome-dinosaur.png" width="142" height="142"></img></a>
    <p>My immediate thought was that some small child must have dropped her and their parent didn't notice. 
      <br>Did the child know it had lost their dino friend? Did the dino know it had been abandoned?
      <br>My second though was whether I should leave Dinky Dino or take her on an adventure. 
      <br>Though I suppose work is hardly an advanture, but to a Dinky Dino it could be.</p>
